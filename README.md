ThreeMobile Customer Churn Analysis
===================================

Overview
--------

The ThreeMobile Customer Churn Analysis project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunications context using data science methods. The project prioritizes performance insights and churn prediction using statistical and machine learning methods, specifically emphasizing deep survival analysis techniques to understand customer lifetimes.


Description
-----------

This project employs a comprehensive analysis of customer churn using demographic data, usage patterns, and transaction history to create predictive models. By employing deep learning for survival analysis, we attempt to estimate the time until a customer might churn and the factors leading up to this event.

Key components include:

-   Data processing and imputation techniques.
-   Building a deep learning model (`DeepSurv`) to predict survival probabilities.
-   Visualizing survival curves to analyze risk and customer behavior over time.
-   Analyzing various customer features and their correlations with churn.



Deep Survival Analysis
----------------------

Deep survival analysis is an advanced statistical methodology that integrates deep learning techniques with survival analysis. This approach is particularly valuable in contexts like customer churn prediction, where understanding the time until an event (such as customer churn) occurs is crucial. As customer behavior becomes increasingly complex and data dimensions grow, traditional models can fall short. This is where deep survival analysis excels.

### Why Use Deep Survival Analysis?

1.  Capturing Complex Relationships:

    -   Traditional survival models, such as the Cox proportional hazards model, assume linear relationships between covariates and the hazard function. This assumption may not hold in real-world scenarios where factors influencing churn can interact in non-linear ways. Deep survival analysis, leveraging neural networks, can naturally model these complexities, allowing for richer representations of data.
2.  Handling High Dimensional Data:

    -   Businesses often collect vast amounts of data across various dimensions (demographics, usage patterns, behavioral metrics). Deep learning models can effectively process high dimensional datasets, identifying significant patterns and interactions that might remain hidden with traditional methods.
3.  Incorporating Censoring Effectively:

    -   Many customers may not have churned by the end of the observation period, leading to censored data. Deep survival analysis incorporates mechanisms to handle censored observations directly within the model training process, thus improving accuracy in predictions.
4.  Flexibility in Modeling:

    -   Deep survival models can adapt to new incoming data and changes in customer behavior over time without needing to re-specify model structures. This adaptability is essential for companies operating in fast-paced environments where customer preferences and behaviors can shift rapidly.
5.  Scalability:

    -   As customer data grows, deep survival models scale seamlessly, maintaining performance without extensive re-engineering. This scalability makes it ideal for businesses looking to grow and adapt their predictive capabilities continuously.

### Comparison with Cox Proportional Hazards Model

-   Assumptions:

    -   The Cox model relies on the proportional hazards assumption---that the ratio of the hazards for any two individuals is constant over time. Deep survival models do not impose such restrictions, allowing for varying hazard ratios that can change dynamically based on customer interactions and lifecycle stages.
-   Feature Interactions:

    -   In traditional models, feature interactions must be manually specified, which can be cumbersome and prone to omission of important variables. Deep survival models automatically learn interactions between features, capturing intricate interdependencies without explicit specification.
-   Performance:

    -   In empirical studies, deep survival models have demonstrated superior predictive performance in many applications, particularly where the underlying distributions of survival times are complex and influenced by multiple non-linear factors.

Machine Learning Models for Customer Churn Prediction
-----------------------------------------------------

In the context of customer churn prediction, a variety of machine learning models can be applied to effectively classify customers as likely to churn or not. The following models are implemented in the analysis, utilizing pre-processed features derived from the data, including insights gained from deep survival analysis.

### 1\. Model Selection

The following four machine learning algorithms are chosen to classify customer churn based on their performance and ability to handle imbalanced datasets:

-   Random Forest Classifier:

    -   An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (majority voting) or mean prediction (regression). Random forests handle overfitting well and can capture complex interactions in the data.
-   Gradient Boosting Classifier:

    -   This model builds trees sequentially, where each tree aims to correct the errors of the previous ones, making it a powerful algorithm for handling a variety of prediction tasks. It works well on structured data, like customer demographics and usage stats.
-   LightGBM Classifier:

    -   This is a gradient boosting framework that uses a histogram-based algorithm. LightGBM is designed for distributed and efficient training, making it well-suited for larger datasets. It is particularly effective at managing categorical features and can significantly reduce training time.
-   XGBoost Classifier:

    -   Another gradient boosting model known for its speed and performance. XGBoost optimizes both memory efficiency and computational speed, making it one of the most popular algorithms for competitive data science tasks.

### 2\. Data Processing

Before applying these models, the following steps are taken to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the predictions:

-   Data Splitting:

    -   The dataset is divided into training and test sets, with 80% allocated for training and 20% for testing. This enables evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.
-   Feature Scaling:

    -   Non-binary columns are standardized using `StandardScaler` to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process, which is crucial for algorithms sensitive to input scales.
-   Handling Imbalanced Data:

    -   Resampling techniques such as SMOTEENN (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique combined with Edited Nearest Neighbors) are employed to balance the class distribution. This helps improve the model's ability to predict the minority class (customers likely to churn).

### 3\. Model Training and Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated based on a variety of performance metrics:

-   Accuracy: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances (both churned and non-churned).
-   Precision: Evaluates the accuracy of positive predictions (i.e., of all predicted 'churned', how many were actually 'churned').
-   Recall: Indicates the ability of a model to find all relevant cases (i.e., of all actual 'churned', how many were correctly predicted).
-   F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
-   ROC-AUC: The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, which aggregates performance across all classification thresholds.
-   Average Precision: Represents the average precision score across recall values, giving a single score reflecting the predicted precision-recall trade-off.

### 4\. Results Visualization

For a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance, the following visualizations are generated:

-   Confusion Matrix: Displays the counts of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions. This aids in visualizing the accuracy of the classification.

-   Precision-Recall Curve: This plot illustrates the trade-off between precision and recall for different probability thresholds, helping to evaluate model performance in terms of class imbalance.

-   ROC Curve: This graph shows the relationship between the true positive rate and the false positive rate, facilitating the assessment of model performance at various classification thresholds.

-   Feature Importance: For tree-based models, feature importance can be visualized to identify which features had the most significant impact on the predictions, guiding further analysis and feature selection.

### 5\. Performance Comparison

After training and evaluating all models, a results summary is displayed to compare performance across all metrics. This allows stakeholders to identify the best-performing model for predicting customer churn, ensuring that decisions regarding customer retention strategies are data-driven.
